I'm a second-year master's student in the [Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences), [Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-social-and-behavioural-sciences), [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en). My research interests lie in **causal inference**, **prediction modeling**, and their applications in **public health** and **health economics**.

Currently, my master's thesis focuses on validating the theoretical behavior of prognostic and diagnostic models under shifts in case-mix. Specifically, I build multiple **prognostic** and **diagnostic models** using **logistic regression** to investigate how **calibration remains unchanged in prognostic models**, while **discrimination remains stable in diagnostic models**, despite variations in case-mix. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of model behavior and robustness, which is critical for reliable clinical and policy decision-making.


I am fortunate to be advised by [Wouter van Amsterdam](https://wvanamsterdam.com/)) at University Medical Center Utrecht.
